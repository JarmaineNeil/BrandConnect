🎯 The Core Concept (Simplified)

A two-sided marketplace:

👤 Influencers

Create a profile

Connect social accounts

Show:

Followers

Engagement rate

Niche

Audience demographics

Choose deal types they accept:

💰 Commission

📦 Care package

💵 One-time payment

🏢 Brands

Post campaigns

Browse influencers by niche + metrics

Pay for promotions

Track deliverables

You are the trusted middleman.

🧠 KEY INSIGHT (This is where most fail)

Do NOT start with:

“All influencers, all platforms, all brands”

You will die.

Start with:

One platform

One region

One influencer size

Example:

PH-based TikTok micro-influencers (5k–100k followers) for beauty & food brands

That’s how you win.

🔌 Influencer Metrics (How to Handle Reality)
Phase 1 (MVP)

Influencers input:

Followers

Avg likes

Avg comments

You calculate engagement rate

Yes, people can lie — but it’s fine early on.

Phase 2 (Automation)

Use APIs later:

TikTok Creator Marketplace

Instagram Graph API

Pull real stats

🚨 Don’t block launch because of APIs.

Existing platforms:

Too expensive

Not niche-focused

You can be smaller, faster, and more human.
